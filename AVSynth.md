### Embedded Video Subsystem
The video synthesis embedded subsystem is the end of the audio-visual synthesis chain.
It is responsible for taking periodic measurements of the analog audio signal generated by the
audio processing subsystems, and generating visualizations that correspond to the frequency
content of the audio input. The system also manages part of the interface, it runs an LCD
interface and three rotary encoders providing more finetune control over how the visuals are
generated. The LCD interface allows the user to adjust the base animation, and how sensitive the visual effects are to the audio input, the rotary encoders give direct access to graphical effects such as
zooming in or out of the display. 

**HARDWARE**

The hardware components are:
- Raspberry Pi 5
- 3d Sound USB Soundcard with a PCM2902 CODEC 
- Orbital Matrix LCD Display


**SOFTWARE**

The programming for the graphics is done in a mix of C++ and Python. The code handling the audio input and LCD interface is done in Python.
