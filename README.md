# Hello and Welcome!
My name is **Alexander Owen** and here you can find my favorite projects from school and from my personal life. This main readme will contain a summary of the contents, but feel free to check out the associated project folders for more details. I have just begun centralizing my work here so there will be frequent updates to many of the entries.
## Audio Visual Synthesizer
This project was focused on creating a standalone, non-modular audiovisual synthesizer. The goal was to create an all-in-one device that integrated a analog audio synthesis system with an embedded system with an SoC that could output a video signal that tracked the input audio in real time. 
### Labor Distribution
The work was split amongst five subteams: 

- Audio Synthesis System
- Power System
- Embedded Systems - Audio Control
- Embedded Systems - Video Synthesis
- Interface

I was the lead for the design and development of the Video Synthesis Embedded Subsystem.

And here is a test link.
