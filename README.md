# Hello and Welcome!
My name is **Alexander Owen** and here you can find my favorite projects from school and from my personal life. This main readme will contain a summary of the contents, but feel free to check out the associated project folders for more details. I have just begun centralizing my work here so there will be frequent updates and projects added in the near future.
